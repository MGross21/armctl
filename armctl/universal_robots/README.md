# Universal Robots

This document provides resources and references for interfacing with Universal Robots controllers, with a focus on communication protocols, data exchange, and available software libraries.

## Communication and Port Access

- [Remote Control via TCP/IP](https://www.universal-robots.com/articles/ur/interface-communication/remote-control-via-tcpip/): Official guide for accessing and controlling UR robots over TCP/IP.
- [Socket Script Example Document](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ur-support-site/29983/Script%20command%20Examples.pdf)

## Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE)

RTDE is a proprietary protocol for real-time data synchronization with Universal Robots controllers.
